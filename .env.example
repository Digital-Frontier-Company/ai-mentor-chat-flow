# Supabase Configuration
# This project now uses a centralized configuration approach in src/config/index.ts
# If you wish to use environment variables instead, modify the config file accordingly

# Client-side variables (exposed to browser)
# Only include variables that are safe to expose
# VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://bapditcjlxctrisoixpg.supabase.co
# VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Server-side variables (Edge Functions)
# These should NEVER be exposed to the client
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here

# OpenAI Configuration (for edge functions)
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# Other Configuration
# Add any other environment variables your application needs
